Between the years 2016-2020, I took the Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I work with IPM Motor in the control of the axial fan used in the HVAC field in my graduate student. I studied motor control and power electronics. At the same time, I worked with motor driver, Brushless motor driver, Filter circuits, HVAC control panels and BLDC motor in Kormas company. I have published a Turkish article and an English section about BLDC motor. I made articles and presentations about standards and plans (CanBus, LinBus) used in automotive and I used CanBus actively. I used Altium for PCB design, Matlab for simulation, Keil u5 with Stm for software, CCS C with PIC. I realized the applications in the field with PIC16 and STM32.
